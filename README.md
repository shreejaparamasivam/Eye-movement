Eye Movement Tracker is a tool that detects and tracks eyeball movements using computer vision techniques.
This project allows you to analyze the direction of gaze, blinks, and patterns of eye movement using a webcam or a video feed.
It is designed to be used for research purposes, human-computer interaction, or even as a building block for accessibility tools.

Key Features:
Real-time Eye Tracking: Tracks the user's eye movements in real time using a webcam feed.
Blink Detection: Recognizes and logs instances when the user blinks.
Gaze Direction: Estimates the direction in which the user is looking (left, right, up, down).
Calibration Mode: A tool for calibrating the tracker for improved accuracy based on the user's eye shape.
Recording and Playback: Records eye movements for later analysis and playback.
